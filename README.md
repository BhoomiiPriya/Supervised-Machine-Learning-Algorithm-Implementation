# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Implementation
This repository contains practical implementations of various supervised machine learning algorithms,Each algorithm is implemented from scratch (where applicable) and/or using popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, with clear explanations and well-structured code.
Covered Algorithms:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
